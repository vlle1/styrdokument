## About the Royal Computer Science Chapter (Datasektionen)

The Royal Computer Science Chapter ("Datasektionen") is a non-profit association that works for the benefit of our members. We have statutes ("stadgar") and by-laws ("reglemente") - as well as many other documents. However, as a non-profit association, we primarily follow swedish law. After that also the statutes, by-laws and policies of "Tekniska Högskolan Studentkår"(THS) , the student union of KTH.

## Section documents

The Computer Science Chapter also has its own documents. To regulate our own activities, we have our statutes and by-laws. The Treasurer ("kassör") is responsible for the section's financial procedures - these can be found in the economic regulation document. Then we have a bunch of policy documents that describe how specific parts of our operations should be run, for example recruitment in the recruitment policy. All documents other than the statutes and by-laws are listed under §2 of the By-laws.

The Cohabitation Agreement ("Samboendeavtalet"), which describes how META is to be run and what applies, is available [here (swedish)](https://dsekt.se/samboendeavtal).
