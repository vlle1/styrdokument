§1 Responsibilities
============



For those that assume elected office as δ-officer it will not just be a simple cake walk. As a δ-officer one has responsibilities and there are a number of obligations that we in the D-directorate want all δ-officers to follow. The purpose of this text is to try to give clarity in what these obligations are and what one can get by following them.

§1.1 Mail
----

As a δ-officer you have an official email address which the D-directorate and others that want to come in contact with you will use. Check your email and answer it at least every third day.

§1.2 Handover
-----------

When your term of office ends someone else takes over. It’s your obligation to be available and answer questions and help your successor on the post, so that no one has to start from square one. It’s also recommended that you and your successor keep in touch even after the handover so that any questions can be asked and answered. Respectively, you should be aware that you can contact your predecessor.

§1.3 Testament
----------

In order for no knowledge to be forgotten between you and your successor, and to avoid the same wheel having to be invented again, it’s your obligation as officer to write a testament when your term of office has ended.

§1.4 Reports
---------

At every chapter meeting you are expected as δ-officer to write a report on what you have been doing since the previous chapter meeting. This is done so that the chapter gains knowledge on what you are doing and what you have done.

§1.5 Attend educational seminars
----------------

We arrange two educational seminars for officers every year. If you really can’t attend the first seminar you have six months to try to attend the next. It’s your obligation to attend at least one of these seminars.

§1.6 D-råd
-----------------

Most officers belong to one of the subject specific counsels that exist internally on the chapter. The purpose of the counseling sessions is to give a platform for communication and cooperation in specific areas such as industry, education and chapter hall matters that affects the chapter. There are around 4 counseling sessions per year. A counseling session is coordinated by someone from the D-directorate and it’s the officer’s obligation to attend if possible. The D-directorate decides which counsels that exist and their composition. officers that don’t belong to a counsel will instead have individual development talks with someone from the board.

§1.7 Team building
------------

Several times a year the D-directorate will invite δ-officers to team building events. It’s strongly recommended to attend on these events. They are both an opportunity for learning and to increase relations between you and other δ-officers. Not to mention that it will also be fun, of course.

§1.8 Representative of the CS Chapter
------------------------------

As δ-officer you are a representative of the CS Chapter. This means that everything you write using your official email and on other official information channels can be interpreted as coming from the CS Chapter. Even as a person you represent the CS Chapter and what you do and say can be interpreted as coming from the CS Chapter.

§1.9 
-------------------------------
During their term of office, an officer should plan and to the best of their ability work towards fulfilling their operation goals. The work process shall be documented in the chapter’s system for the operational plan.

§2 Rewards
==========

For a job well done during your time as δ-officer, and if you have done all of the above with content there are a number of things the D-directorate does in order to show its appreciation:

-   Every year during spring the D-directorate arrange a skiftesgasque which all retiring and newly admitted δ-officers that have done a good job will be invited to.

-   A δ-officer that has done a good job, will after one’s retirement be given a medal from the D-directorate to show our appreciation for the effort.
