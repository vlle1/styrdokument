# §1 Responsibilities

For those who accept a position of trust as a official ("funktionär"), it is not all fun and games. As a official you have a responsibility and there are a number of obligations that we in the board ("styrelse") want all officials to follow. This text will try to clarify what these obligations are and what can be gained from following them.

## §1.1 Mail

As an official you have an official email address which the board and others that want to come in contact with you will use. Check your email and answer it at least every third day.

## §1.2 Handover

When your term of office ends someone else takes over. It's your obligation to be available and answer questions and help your successor on the post, so that no one has to start from square one. It's also recommended that you and your successor keep in touch even after the handover so that any questions can be asked and answered. Respectively, you should be aware that you can contact your predecessor.

## §1.3 Testament

In order for no knowledge to be forgotten between you and your successor, and to avoid the same wheel having to be invented again, it's your obligation as official to write a testament ("testamente") when your term of office has ended.

## §1.4 Reports

At every chapter meeting ("Sektionsmöte") you are expected as official to write a report ("rapport") on what you have been doing since the previous chapter meeting. This is done so that the chapter gains knowledge on what you are doing and what you have done.

## §1.5 Attend training seminars

Every semester there is a general training ("funktionärsutbildning") and an equality training ("JML-utbildning"). As an official, it is your obligation to attend the general training once during your term of office, unless you have already attended it in a previous term. The board always has the right to request that you attend the general training during a specific term, in which case it is your obligation. You have an obligation to attend the equality training once during your mandate.

## §1.6 D-council

Most officials belong to one of the subject specific councils ("råd") that exist within the chapter. The aim of the councils is to provide a platform for communication and collaboration regarding chapter-related issues like for example business ("näringsliv"), education ("utbildning") and premises ("lokal"); they meet about four times a year. A council is coordinated by a board member and it is the duty of the officials to participate as much as possible. The board decides which councils exist and determines their composition. Officials who are not part of a council instead have individual development discussions with a member of the board.

## §1.7 Team-building

Several times a year the board will invite officials to team-building events. It is highly recommended to attend these, as they can be seen both as a training session but also as an important opportunity to strengthen the relationships among you and the other officials. As well as being fun of course.

## §1.8 Representing the CS Chapter

As official you are representing the CS Chapter. This means that everything you write using your official email and on other official information channels ("officiella informationskanaler") can be interpreted as coming from the CS Chapter. Even as a person you represent the CS Chapter and what you do and say can be interpreted as coming from the CS Chapter.

## §1.9 Operational goals

During their term of office, an official should plan and to the best of their ability work towards fulfilling their operation goals ("verksamhetsmål"). The work process shall be documented in the chapters system for the operational plan ("verksamhetsplan").

# §2 Rewards

For a job well done during your time as official, and if you have done all of the above with content there are a number of things the board does in order to show its appreciation:

- Every year during spring the board arranges the shift-gasque ("skiftesgasque") which all retiring and newly admitted officials that have done a good job will be invited to.

- A official that has done a good job, will after ones retirement be given a medal from the board to show our appreciation for the effort.
