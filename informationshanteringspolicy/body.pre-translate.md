<!-- Information handling policy of the Royal Data Section ("Informationshanteringspolicy") -->

# §1 Formalities ("Formalia")

This document describes how the chapter ("sektionen") handles and uses members' data in order to organize the chapter's activities.

## §1.2 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to set clear procedures for how the chapter ("sektionen") works with personal data. Both by ensuring how the chapter ("sektionen") handles members' personal data and the purposes for which it may be used.

## §1.3 Scope

These procedures apply to the chapter ("sektionen") and all those involved in its activities.

## §1.4 Responsibility

board ("Styrelsen") is the data controller for the chapter ("sektionen") and can be contacted at [drek@datasektionen.se](mailto:drek@datasektionen.se).

# §2 Background

## §2.1 Legal basis

Through provisions in the Higher Education Act and the Student Union Ordinance, it is established in Swedish law that the student unions at state universities and colleges conduct activities that are a task of public interest. The processing of personal data that is necessary to carry out activities based on the aforementioned regulations can therefore be carried out on the legal basis of a task of **general interest** in accordance with **Article 6(1)(e)** of the EU Data Protection Regulation. Other possible grounds:

- **consent** under **Article 6(1)(a)** of the GDPR.
- **performance** of contracts under **Article 6(1)(b)** of the GDPR.
- **legal obligation** under **Article 6(1)(c)** of the GDPR.
- **balancing of interests** under **Article 6(1)(f)** of the GDPR.

# §3 Your rights

## §3.1 Access to processed data

To gain insight into what data the chapter ("sektionen") processes about you, you can always request this in the form of a register extract. This information is provided with an indication of the purpose for processing the data, the storage period and where the information was obtained from. To request this information, you can contact the section board ("Styrelse") at drek@datasektionen.se. Information should be provided without undue delay and within one month of receipt of the request. If your request cannot be fulfilled within that time, you will be informed of the delay with a justification.

## §3.2 Rectification of processed data

In the event that the chapter ("sektionen") processes incorrect data related to you, you have the right to request rectification. You also have the right to complete incomplete data. If you wish to do this, you can contact the section board ("Styrelse") at drek@datasektionen.se.

## §3.3 Deletion of processed data

The chapter ("sektionen") does not keep data longer than necessary for the respective purpose. However, you can request the deletion of data related to you in the following cases:

- If the data is no longer necessary for the purpose.
- If you withdraw your consent to the processing of the data and the basis for the processing is based on consent.
- You object to a balance of interests the chapter ("sektionen") has made and your reasons for objecting outweigh the chapter's legitimate interest.
- Data is processed in an unlawful manner.
- Data must be erased to comply with a legal obligation to which chapter ("sektionen") is subject.

The chapter ("sektionen") may have the right to refuse a request for erasure if there are legal grounds preventing immediate erasure or if the data is necessary for an ongoing investigation. In that case, the chapter ("sektionen") will instead block the use of the data for purposes other than the one preventing deletion. If you want to request that the chapter ("sektionen") delete data related to you, you can contact the chapter board ("Styrelse") at [drek@datasektionen.se](mailto:drek@datasektionen.se).

## §3.4 Notification of improper processing

If you believe that our processing of your data violates the General Data Protection Regulation, you can report this to the Swedish Data Protection Authority.

# §4 Our handling of your data

## §4.1 Administration of data

When collecting data, there must always be a responsible person who ensures compliance with relevant legislation and internal policies. This person must be available for questions about the data collection and is responsible for removing the data at the time it is no longer needed, for example after an event or in case of deregistration. An email to the person responsible and a link to the section's information handling policy ("Informationshanteringspolicy") must always be included in the form.

## §4.2 Management of incoming e-mails

Incoming e-mails need to be handled in order to carry out the section's activities. However, e-mail always contains contact information and therefore needs to be handled in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation. If
