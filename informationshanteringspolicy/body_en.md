> NOTE: This document is an english interpretation of its swedish counterpart. The chapter is solely regulated by the contents of the swedish version. In case of unclear translations or other discrepancies please contact [the chapter's board](mailto:drek@datasektionen.se).

# §1 Formalities

This document describes how the chapter ("sektionen") handles and uses members' data in order to organize the chapter's activities.

## §1.2 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to set clear procedures for how the chapter works with personal data. Both by ensuring how the chapter handles members' personal data and the purposes for which it may be used.

## §1.3 Scope

These procedures apply to the chapter and all those involved in its activities.

## §1.4 Responsibility

The board ("Styrelsen") is the data controller ("personuppgiftsansvarig") for the chapter and can be contacted at [drek@datasektionen.se](mailto:drek@datasektionen.se).

# §2 Background

## §2.1 Legal basis

Through provisions in the Higher Education Act ("högskolelag") and the Student Union Ordinance ("studentkårsförordning"), it is established in Swedish law that the student unions at state universities and colleges conduct activities that are a task of public interest. The processing of personal data that is necessary to carry out activities based on the aforementioned regulations can therefore be carried out on the legal basis of a task of **general interest** under **Article 6(1)(e)** of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Other possible grounds:

- **consent** under **Article 6(1)(a)** of the GDPR.
- **performance of a contract** under **Article 6(1)(b)** of the GDPR.
- **legal obligation** under **Article 6(1)(c)** of the GDPR.
- **balancing of interests** under **Article 6(1)(f)** of the GDPR.

# §3 Your rights

## §3.1 Access to processed data

To gain insight into what data the chapter ("Kunglig Datasektionen") processes about you, you can always request this in the form of a register extract. This information is provided with an indication of the purpose for processing the data, the storage period and where the information was obtained from. To request this information, you can contact the chapter's board ("Styrelse") at drek@datasektionen.se. Information should be provided without undue delay and within one month of receipt of the request. If your request cannot be fulfilled within that time, you will be informed of the delay with a justification.

## §3.2 Rectification of processed data

In the event that the chapter ("sektionen") processes incorrect data related to you, you have the right to request rectification. You also have the right to complete incomplete data. If you want to do this, you can contact the board ("Styrelse") at drek@datasektionen.se.

## §3.3 Deletion of processed data

The chapter ("sektionen") does not keep data longer than necessary for the respective purpose. However, you can request the deletion of data related to you in the following cases:

- If the data is no longer necessary for the purpose.
- If you withdraw your consent to the processing of the data and the basis for the processing is based on consent.
- You object to a balance of interests the chapter has made and your reasons for objecting outweigh the chapter's legitimate interest.
- Data is processed in an unlawful manner.
- Data must be erased to comply with a legal obligation to which the chapter is subject.

The chapter may have the right to refuse a request for erasure if there are legal grounds preventing immediate erasure or if the data is necessary for an ongoing investigation. In that case, the chapter will instead block the use of the data for purposes other than the one preventing deletion. If you want to request the chapter to delete data related to you, you can contact the chapter's board ("styrelse") at [drek@datasektionen.se](mailto:drek@datasektionen.se).

## §3.4 Notification of improper processing

If you believe that our processing of your data violates the General Data Protection Regulation, you can report this to the Swedish Data Protection Authority ("Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten").

# §4 Our handling of your data

## §4.1 Administration of data

When collecting data, there must always be a responsible person who ensures compliance with relevant legislation and internal policies. This person must be available for questions about the data collection and is responsible for removing the data at the time it is no longer needed, for example after an event or in case of deregistration. An email-address of the responsible and a link to the chapter's information handling policy ("Informationshanteringspolicy") must always be included in the form.

## §4.2 Management of incoming e-mails

Incoming e-mails need to be handled in order to carry out the chapter's activities. However, e-mail always contains contact information and therefore needs to be handled in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If there is personal data that needs to be saved, these should be moved to other systems for further storage and then deleted. Officials should also clear their inbox of all emails every three months to ensure that no processed emails remain. When sending emails to many people, all officials should also use BCC to avoid unnecessary dissemination of personal data.

## §4.3 How we protect data

All personal data should be stored on the Google Drive that the group uses for its work. Only those who are actively involved in the group, the chapter's board ("styrelse") if necessary and the chapter's auditors ("revisorer") may have access to the information stored. Personal data may not be spreaded through other communication channels but should only be handled through Google Drive to avoid creating additional copies. For work that requires a local copy, the work should be saved on Google Drive and all local copies should be deleted as soon as the work is completed. When the information is stored on Drive, there is a chance that the data will be transferred to another country for storage, but this should always comply with the GDPR.
