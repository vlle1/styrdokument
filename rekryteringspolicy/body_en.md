# §1 Purpose and Goals
The purpose of this document is to describe how selection ("inval") and recruitment ("rekrytering") to both clubs ("nämnder") and projects at the CS chapter shall take place. One of the goals of the CS chapter is that all members have equal opportunities to get involved in all parts of the organization. All members must always have the opportunity to apply for positions of trust ("förtroendeposter") elected by the chapter meeting ("sektionsmöte"), as well as for the positions that in turn can be appointed by elected representatives (the latter: "förtroendevalda"). This document aims to outline how those responsible in any context related to selection and recruitment should strive to have open and transparent processes, and how this can be achieved.

# §2 Concepts: Selection and Recruitment

An **open election** to the CS chapter's official posts ("funktionärsposter") is held during the chapter meeting where all members are permitted to apply. The exception is when an official post is vacant, in which case the Board ("styrelse") has the option of appointing a member to fill the post until a by-election can be held to elect a replacement.

**Selection** means that a member of the CS chapter is chosen for a club or a project by one or more elected representatives of the chapter. Selections are, for example, the selection of management groups for projects and, at present, the selection of members of the DKM and reception staff.

**Recruitment** refers to how committees and projects work to engage and recruit more members to their activities.

# §3 Selection
Selection to a club or a project shall be clearly advertised to the chapter's members through the chapter's official information channels. Any member must then be able to expect that decisions made upon selection are well-founded and taken after considering all candidates.

The person in charge for the club or project shall ensure, within reasonable limits, that all applicants are given equal opportunities in the process. This can be done by collecting the information on which the selection decision is based in an equal way for all candidates. For example, questionnaires or interviews that take into account both candidates' personal qualities and their previous experiences can be used.

The responsible official ("funktionär"), together with any recruiting team, should carry out a self-assessment after each selection to ensure that no bias has influenced the decision.

# §4 Recruitment
How chapter members can participate in a club or project should be openly and clearly advertised through the chapter's official information channels when recruitment is in progress. For those clubs and projects that do not consist of a fixed group of members, activities that take place should instead be advertised.

1. The Election Committee ("valberedning") shall be trained in recruitment and shall be chapter's principal resource and authority for selections.
2. The Election Committee will be a resource for clubs and projects in their recruitment efforts.
3. The Election Committee has overall responsibilty for ensuring that recruitment and election are carried out properly within the chapter.
    - Prior to each selection, the responsible official is required to contact the Election Committee with a plan for their selection process.
    - If the Election Commitee deems it necessary, they have the right to request changes to the plan.
4. The Election Committee has the right to request information on the selections of clubs and projects at any time.
    - Such a request can only be made with the approval of the Chair of the Election Committee or by majority vote of the Election Committee.
    - Members of the Election Committee who are standing for election are not entitled to vote on such a request or to receive specific information on that election.
    - The responsible Election Committee member should always be able to justify his/her selection decisions.
    - This information shall be kept confidential and only the current Election Committee and auditors may access it.

# §5 Internal recruitment
Within committees and projects, there may be internal areas of responsibility that are distributed between the engaged members. Examples of internal areas of responsibility can be Städskri in METAdorerna and the Head Bartender in DKM. The opportunity for a member to be responsible for an internal area of responsibility must in these cases be communicated openly within the committee or the project.

# §6 Transparency
In order to contribute to increased transparency in selection ("inval") and recruitment ("rekrytering"), the committee chairman and project manager must present to each SM the basis for selection and recruitment made since the previous SM if selection or recruitment to the committee or project has taken place. The documentation must prove that recruitments and selections have been made in an equal and merit-based manner. This does not mean that recruitment or selection must be justified at the individual level, but can in practice mean that you present, for example, what experience and / or which personal qualities have generally been sought after in candidates.
