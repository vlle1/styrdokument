## §1 Purpose and goals

The purpose of this document is to describe how selection and recruitment to both committees and projects at the CS chapter is to take place. One goal for the CS chapter is that all members have equal opportunities to get involved in all parts of the organization. All members must always have the opportunity to apply for positions elected by the chapter meeting, as well as for the positions that in turn can be appointed by elected representatives. This document aims to describe how those responsible in all contexts related to selection and recruitment should strive to have open and transparent processes, and how this can be achieved.

## §2 Concept: selection and recruitment

An ** open election ** to the CS chapter's officer posts is held during the chapter meeting where all members have the right to apply for the posts. The exception is when an officer post is vacant, then the board has the opportunity to appoint a member to the position until the post can be filled.

** Selection ** means that a member of the CS chapter is elected to a committee or a project by one or more elected representatives of the chapter. Selections are, for example, the selection of management groups for projects and, at present, the selection of members of DKM and reception staff.

** Recruitment ** refers to how committees and projects work to engage and recruit more members to their activities.

## §3 Selection

Selections that occur for committees or projects must be clearly marketed to the chapter's members in the chapter's official information channels. A member must then be able to expect that decisions made in the selection are well-founded and made after taking all candidates into account.

The person who is responsible for the committee or project must within reasonable limits ensure that everyone who applies is given equal opportunity in the process. This can be done by collecting the information that forms the basis for the selection decision in an equal way for all candidates. For example, questionnaires or interviews that take into account both candidates' personal characteristics and previous experiences can be used.

## §4 Recruitment

How chapter members can participate in committees or projects should be openly and clearly announced on the chapter's official information channels when recruitment is in progress. For those committees and projects that do not consist of a fixed group of members, activities that take place should instead be announced.

## §5 Internal recruitment

Within committees and projects, there may be internal areas of responsibility that are distributed between the committed members. Examples of internal areas of responsibility can be städskri in METAdorerna and barmasters in DKM. The opportunity for a member to be responsible for an internal area of ​​responsibility must in these cases be communicated openly within the committee or the project.

## §6 Transparency

In order to contribute to increased transparency in selection and recruitment, the committee chairman and project manager must present to each SM the basis for selection and recruitment made since the previous SM if selection or recruitment to the committee or project has taken place. The documentation must prove that recruitments and selections have been made in an equal and merit-based manner. This does not mean that recruitment or selection must be justified at the individual level, but can in practice mean that you present, for example, what experience and / or which personal qualities have generally been sought after in candidates.
