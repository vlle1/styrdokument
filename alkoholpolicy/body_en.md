# §1 Relation to other regulations

THS has an alcohol and drug policy that is established by the Student Union Council and applies within the entire THS organization, the Computer Science Chapter included. This document should be seen as a complement to THS alcohol and drug policy.

In cases where this document is in conflict with the law of the Kingdom of Sweden, THS alcohol and drug policy, or other rules set by KTH or THS, this document is subordinate.

# §2 Scope

This policy covers all activities that are carried out by the chapter or activities that are arranged in the chapter hall, and must be complied with.

# §3 Opening the bar

To be allowed to open the bar, the approval of the Chapter President or Club Master is required. At alcohol events at KTH, KTH requires that a party registration is made. This party registration must also be sent to the Chapter President. When the bar opens, there must be a serving responsible who has completed the STAD training. This person must also be registered with the Licensing Unit as serving responsible for the CS Chapter. There must also be a person who is responsible for the party who has undergone KTH's FEST training.

# §4 Alcohol during school hours

08:00–17:00 every non-holiday weekday is to be regarded as school time, and during this time alcohol may not be consumed in the chapter hall unless it is part of an event for which the room is booked.

# §5 Alcohol outside the chapter hall

It is not permitted to carry the chapter's alcohol outside of the serving area, even if the bar is closed, for purposes other than moving the alcohol to an activity arranged by the Chapter or to return the alcohol to the retailer.

# §6 Alcohol in the chapter hall

It is not allowed to bring your own alcohol to the chapter hall, either for sale or private use. If serving alcohol is desired, a qualified person from the chapters must be present. The Chapter always reserves the right to refuse serving alcohol.

# §7 Sober staff

Staff working at the chapter's events should always be sober, regardless of context. The serving staff and party manager must always be completely alcohol-free during events.

# §8 Alcohol during sittings

In the case of sittings that use the Chapter’s alcohol permit, the serving responsible is responsible for noting and reporting the drink served during the sitting in accordance with the routines instructed by the Treasurer.

# §9 Activities outside the permanent serving permit

For events outside the Chapter's permanent serving permit, the necessary permits must be obtained. If a temporary alcohol permit has not been obtained, alcohol serving shall nevertheless only take place in accordance with the Alcohol law. This means, for example, that selling alcohol with a profit in Osqvik may only take place if a permit has been obtained. All alcohol served outside the Chapter's alcohol permit must be purchased from Systembolaget and may not be taken from the chapter's beverage stores.

# §10 Alcohol behind bar counter

Alcohol must not be consumed behind the bar.

# §11 Self-service

No one may sell and serve alcohol to themselves.

# §12 Alcohol paid for by the section

A maximum of 1/3 of the money spent on an occasion with an internal group may be used to pay for alcohol. Meaning that, for example, only a third of the money spent during e.g. a team building can be spent on alcohol.

# THS Alcohol and Drug Policy

The CS Chapter follows the THS Alcohol and Drug Policy. The policy can be found [here] (https://ths.kth.se/general/ths-central/policy-documents-and-meeting-protocols)
