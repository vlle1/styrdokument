> NOTE: This document is an english interpretation of its swedish counterpart. The chapter is solely regulated by the contents of the swedish version. In case of unclear translations or other discrepancies please contact [the chapter's board](mailto:drek@datasektionen.se).

# §1 Relation to other regulations

THS has an alcohol and drug policy that is established by the Student Union Council ("Kårfullmäktige") and applies within the entire THS organization, the Computer Science Chapter included. This document should be seen as an addition to THS alcohol and drug policy.

In cases where this document is in conflict with the law of Sweden, THS alcohol and drug policy, or other rules set by KTH or THS, this document is subordinate.

# §2 Scope

This policy covers all activities that are carried out by the chapter or activities that are arranged in the chapter hall, and must be complied with.

# §3 Opening the bar

To be allowed to open the bar, the approval of the Chairperson or Head Bartender is required. At alcohol events at KTH, KTH requires that a event registration ("festanmälan") is made. This event registration must also be sent to the Chairperson. When the bar is opened, there must be a serving responsible who has completed KTH's serving training ("STAD-utbildning"). This person must also be registered with the Licensing Authority ("Tillståndsenheten") as serving responsible for the CS Chapter. There must also be a person who is responsible for the event ("festansvarig") who has undergone KTH's event training.

# §4 Alcohol during school hours

08:00–17:00 every non-holiday weekday is to be regarded as school time, and during this time alcohol may not be consumed in the chapter hall unless it is part of an event for which the room is booked.

# §5 Alcohol outside the chapter hall

It is not permitted to carry the chapter's alcohol outside of the serving area, even if the bar is closed, for purposes other than moving the alcohol to an activity arranged by the Chapter or to return the alcohol to the retailer.

# §6 Alcohol in the chapter hall

It is not allowed to bring your own alcohol to the chapter hall, either for sale or private use. If serving alcohol is desired, a qualified person from the chapters must be present. The Chapter always reserves the right to refuse serving alcohol.

# §7 Sober staff

Staff working at the chapter's events must always be sober, regardless of context. The serving staff and party manager must always be completely alcohol-free during events.

# §8 Alcohol during sittings

In the case of sittings that use the Chapter's alcohol permit, the serving responsible is responsible for noting and reporting the drink served during the sitting in accordance with the routines instructed by the Treasurer ("Kassör").

# §9 Activities outside the permanent serving permit

For events outside the Chapter's permanent serving permit, the necessary permits must be obtained. If a temporary alcohol permit ("tillfälligt alkoholtillstånd") has not been obtained, alcohol serving shall nevertheless only take place in accordance with the alcohol law ("alkohollag"). This means, for example, that selling alcohol with a profit in Osqvik may only take place if a permit has been obtained. All alcohol served outside the Chapter's alcohol permit must be purchased from Systembolaget and may not be taken from the chapter's beverage storage.

# §10 Alcohol behind bar counter

Alcohol must not be consumed behind the bar.

# §11 Self-service

No one may sell and serve alcohol to themselves.

# §12 Alcohol paid for by the chapter

A maximum of 1/3 of the money spent on food and drink on an occasion with an internal group may be used to pay for alcohol. It is not allowed to give people who drink alcohol a larger budget than those who do not in order to pay for more alcohol.

# THS Alcohol and Drug Policy
