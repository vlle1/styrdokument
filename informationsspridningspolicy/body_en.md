# §1 About this document

This document contains guidelines for how information is to be disseminated within the chapter. The word informant below means the CS chapter, its committees and / or its officials.

# §2 Official information channels

The chapter's website is its official information channel. Therefore, information that may interest the members of the chapter in general should be published there first. Furthermore, documents such as summons, agendas, protocols and agreements that may interest the chapter's members must be physically displayed in the chapter hall in paper format, then at least in A4 format. Such information that can be presented well in large screen format should also be published on the TV screens in the chapter hall, if such screens exist.

# §3 Unofficial information channels

Informants may use their own information channels in addition to the official ones. Information in these unofficial channels must correspond to that contained in the official ones. The CS chapter must have representation in dominant social media. Information that is not considered interesting for the members of the chapter in general may be published in the unofficial channels without being published in the official channels.

# §4 Information in English

Information sent to the members of the chapter shall, as much as possible, be translated into English. In addition, information that is deemed to be of great importance for all of the chapter's members to be able to take part in must always be summarized in English. Examples of when this is applicable are decisions made at the chapter meeting and information concerning the chapter hall.

# §5 Registration for events

Events arranged by the informant shall not require guests to log in to any external service (KTH login is, however, a permitted alternative) for access to registration or information about the event. Registration for events aimed at the chapter's members in general must be opened at the same time for all chapter members. However, it is allowed to reserve a certain number of places for people who have a place of honor at the event. Such a reservation must be evident when registering for the event.

# §6 Sensitive information

Personal information and actions that may be considered sensitive to individuals must be handled with care and respect. These may only be disseminated or published in internal, protected information channels and with the express approval of the individuals concerned.

# §7 Presence in information channels

The chapter's informants should be aware of their presence as representatives in official and unofficial contexts - for example, the CS chapter's website as well as in comment fields and mailing lists. All members should also be aware that our mailing lists should be free from, for example, personal attacks, threats, incitement against ethnic groups and sexual harassment, and that grossly inappropriate behavior in these can be followed up with temporary suspension from them if necessary. When deciding to suspend a member from an information channel, the auditors must always be notified.
