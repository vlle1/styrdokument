# §1 Background

This document has two functions. Firstly, it will set out the rules for how the chapter's finances ("ekonomin") are managed. The document should also serve as a quick tutorial in how officials ("funktionärer") and committees ("nämnder") should manage their finances and financial accounts ("ekonomiska redovisning").

# §2 Accounting duty

Committees that have accounting duty ("bokförningsplikt") such as DKM and the Reception, and certain projects must manage their own accounting ("bokförning"). Accounting shall be done continuously with the aim of being completed no later than the end of the next month as long as it's not summer vacation. In addition to this objective, the Treasurer ("Kassör") can set additional accounting deadlines. If a committee or project does not meet the given deadlines, the board has the right to apply restrictions to its activities, such as prohibiting the use of the chapter's serving license ("alkoholtillstånd"). If a committee or project does its accounting continuously and works toward the given deadlines, the committee/project can be rewarded. One can get extra funds to its fika/team-building budget from a budget item reserved for this purpose. Whether to distribute these funds is determined and performed by the Treasurer.

# §3 Debts to volunteers

Any receipt ("Kvitto") for a purchase done for the chapter shall be at the latest handed in 30 days after the purchase, in order for the debt to be paid back. After that the repayment can be denied. Debts shall be paid back within 5 weeks (excluding holidays), provided that all information is correctly recorded and the purpose of the purchase is clear.

# §4 Storage

## §4.1 Management of beverage storage

Data's bartenders ("Datas Klubbmästeri", DKM) manage the chapter's beverage storage, except under the reception period where the Reception ("Mottagningen") takes over this responsibility. This implies that it's mainly DKM that will refill the storage and document the refilling. Spirits, wine, cider and beer served on pub and club activities shall be stocked.

Beverage stocks shall be inventoried at least once every two months and before and after the reception period. The inventory value shall be reconciled with the accounts by means of a result group specifically designated by the Treasurer. The standard amounts mentioned in §[4.2] shall be adjusted in order to minimize the differences in the inventory.

## §4.2 beverage storage during parties

When a committee or project throws a party and uses the chapter's beverage storage, it shall be entered into the accounts by the commitee's or project's accounting responsible the party. The committee/project should be charged for the purchase of the drinks and allocated the sale of the drinks. The cost for the purchase shall be calculated according to the flat rate provided by the Treasurer. The serving manager ("serveringsansvarig") for the party is responsible for that payment and an end of day report ("dagsavslut") is made according to the chapter's standards. The serving manager is also responsible for the treatment of any possible cash boxes ("handkassor") according to §[4] in this document. The serving manager shall within a reasonable time before the party contact the committee that manages the beverage storage and inform oneself of the regulations currently applicable to the chapter.

## §4.3 Other storages

Other storages (the overall storage for instance) shall be taken stock of once every year at the least. Such stocktaking shall be reported to the Treasurer as soon as possible.

# §5 Receipts

A receipt or alternatively an invoice shall be offered in some form for all sales.

# §6 Invoices

## §6.1 Purchase by invoice

Purchasing by invoice ("faktura") usually means using one of the chapter's credit agreements ("kreditavtal"). This may be done by chapter officials, both directly (the official using the credit agreement) or indirectly (another person using the credit agreement on the order of the official). It is the official's responsibility to ensure that there is room in the budget for the costs. As a rule, it is possible to use credit agreements written by other bodies within the chaptor than the one you are buying for, but the person making the purchase is responsible for being informed about the limits of the credit agreement.

Large purchases of over 50000 SEK that may affect the chapter's finances in general should be notified to the Treasurer as soon as it becomes known.

All invoices in the name of the chapter should be sent to the chapter's current invoice address.

## §6.2 sales by invoice

Invoices ("fakturor") issued by the chapter shall be created through a method specified by the Treasurer. Committees are responsible for continuously verifying that sent invoices are paid on time. A copy of the invoice shall be given to the accounting responsible.

# §7 Budget

The budget ("budget") is an instrument used to attempt to plan and predict how the economy of the financial year ("verksamhetsår") will look like. The budget shall be followed as much as possible, although if reality doesn't allow this, one may need to disregard the budget. If a budget needs to be breached, the Treasurer must be informed of this before the breach has occurred. The overall budget ("rambudget") decided by the chapter meeting ("Sektionsmöte", SM) includes the items _Income_ ("_Intänker_") and _Expenditure_ ("_Utgifter_"). In addition to this, it is required that for each committee and project, a detailed budget ("detaljbudget"), that balances or has a better result than the framework budget, can be presented  at the SM. Officials who manage a detailed budget may, in consultation with the board, revise it during or before a financial year. Such changes must be reported at the board meeting ("Direktionsmöte", DM).

## §7.1 Obligation

The budget still requires that money is laid on the right things (??) and that those with the right to pay for the expenses can deny payment, if the regulations within this document are not followed. The decision can be appealed according to the order in §[A].

## §7.2 Usage of fika budget

Fika budget shall go to purchases of fika on meetings or other activities. It is not necessary to offer fika on all activities. However, in the cases where fika is offered, it should be available for all activity participants. At least two people shall be present on an activity in order for money to be taken from the fika budget. Fika shall not replace a meal.

# §8 Funds

The CS chapter has in addition to those funds that are regulated in the statutes ("stardgar") two other funds, namely the hall fund ("lokalfonden") and the jubilee fund ("jubileumsfonden"). How these funds can be used is regulated below, other usage of fund assets shall be decided at the chapter metting ("sektionsmöte", SM).

## §8.1 Hall fund

The assets of the hall fund ("lokalfonden") shall be used to purchase larger items for the hall and provide a buffer in case the chapter needs to move to a new chapter hall. 

Usage of the hall fund's assets is determined by the board at board meetings ("direktionsmöte", DM). The fund's assets may only be used to pay for items and renovations to the chapter hall. 

The size of the hall fund should be sufficient to pay for the relocation of the chapter hall ("sektionslokal").

## §8.2 Jubilee fund

The purpose of the Jubilee Fund ("Jubileumsfonden") is to avoid an unnecessary burden on a single year's budget in years when the CS chapter ("Datasektionen") celebrates an anniversary. This money may be used for jubilee celebrations by decision of the Board. As the fund's money is not intended to be used every year, it is appropriate that the money is invested with this in mind.

Contributions to the Jubilee Fund should be such that the fund reaches a total of 10 price base amounts ("prisbasbelopp") when an anniversary occurs.

## §8.3 50th anniversary fund

The purpose of the 50th Anniversary Fund ("50-år jubileumsfonden") is to enable a major event on the occasion of the chapter's 50th anniversary. This fund is intended to be used together with the Jubilee Fund (see §[8.2] Jubilee Fund) and therefore constitutes additional resources made available to celebrate the CS chapter's 50th anniversary. This money may be used for anniversary celebrations by decision of the Board. As the fund's money is not intended to be used every year, it is appropriate that the money is invested with this in mind. Contributions to the 50th anniversary fund should be of such a size that the fund reaches a sum of 5 price base amounts ("prisbasbelopp") when a 50th anniversary occurs.

# §9 Subsidization of profile clothing

Clothing belonging to members, e.g. hoodies with personalized print or the reception shirts, is divided into two groups, uniform ("uniform") and profile clothing ("profilkläder"). What falls under uniform is assessed by the board meeting ("direktionsmöte", DM) and must be justified by external regulations from, for example, the Licensing Authority ("Tillståndsenheten") or THS.

Profile clothing may be subsidized to a maximum of 50% of the purchase price. The amount to be subsidized must be budgeted and categorized as an internal cost.

The exception is if the profile clothing is sponsored. The sponsorship is then deducted from the amount that is not subsidized by the chapter. Thus, the entire shirt can be paid by getting 50% or more of the shirt sponsored and the chapter pays the remaining amount from the budget.

# §10 Access

Signatories and the Vice Treasurer ("Vice kassör") have access to view and manage all the chapter's assets and transactions in the bank.
Auditors ("Revisorer") have access to view all the chapters's assets and transactions in the bank.

Committee chairs ("Nämndordförande") and project managers ("projektledare") for committees and projects with accounting duty ("bokföringspliktiga") shall have access to view and manage the assets held in their own committee's/project's bank account.

Accounting officers appointed by the board chair or project manager have the right to view the assets and transactions on the board's/project's bank account.

In addition to these bank accesses, the board may, by decision of the board meeting (DM), decide to give other persons access to view and/or manage the section's assets. Signatories also have the right to withdraw people's access, which must then be reviewed at the next DM.

# §11 Certification

All expenses must be certified. Those who have the right to certify/reject an expense are, in ascending order: committee chairs/project leaders for committees/projects with accounting duty, the Vice Treasurer ("Vice Kassör") and signatories. The committee president/project leader only has the right to certify expenses that are charged to the budget for which they are responsible. Rejection can be appealed according to the procedure in §[A]. However, one may not certify any expenses where oneself have spent money or benefited greatly from the nature of the expense (eg fika to oneself). 

In addition to these rights, the board can, in consultation with the committee president/project leader, decide on extra certification rights at a board meeting (DM). 

An expense ("utlägg") is certified through the chapter's dedicated system. An invoice ("faktura") is certified either through the chapter's dedicated system or by approving the invoice payment at the bank.

# §12 Agreements

According to Swedish law, agreements ("avtal") can only be signed by signatories ("firmatecknare") or holders of a power of attorney ("fullmakt"). Anyone wishing to sign an agreement in the chapter's name must contact a signatory as soon as possible to investigate the possibility of doing so. Agreements or the issuance of a power of attorney are decided to be signed either through a board meeting (DM), with support in governance documents ("styrdokument") or with standard agreements. Agreements can in exceptional cases be signed retroactively. The person who by proxy signs an agreement in the name of the chapter is responsible for the original agreement being sent and received by the signatory as soon as possible. Signatories are responsible for storing all the chapter's current agreements collected and orderly.

# §A Decision procedure

In order to have an organization where we can make quick decisions but at the same time have legal certainty, the parts that refer to this paragraph are assessed by the following bodies in ascending order: Treasurer ("Kassör"), board ("styrelse"), auditors ("revisorer"), chapter meeting ("sektionsmöte", SM). If you believe that a decision is incorrect, you can therefore appeal to a higher instance.
